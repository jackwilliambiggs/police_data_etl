Police Data ETL 

This repository demonstrates a pipeline where I download data from the police API with error handling, manipulate data to make suitable for further analyses and then load to a personal free tier AWS Postgres DB instance.

I feel it important to be candid that I understand that there are improvements to the pipeline that I have created I know I could with additional time. I look forward to discussing these.
